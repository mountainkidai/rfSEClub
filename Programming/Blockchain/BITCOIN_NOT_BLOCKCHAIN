 tHE drawing a line between public and private blockchains, we have entered contentious territory that the innovative investor should understand. The difference between these two types of blockchains and the groups that sup-port them is full of tension, because the two camps have different goals for the technology. At the risk of overgeneralizing, private blockchains are backed by incumbents in their respective industries, while public blockchains are backed by the disruptors.

To round out the context within which the innovative investor approaches cryptoassets, it's important to understand how the world evolved beyond a single blockchain-Bitcoin's blockchain-to include public and private block-chains.

###            Bitcoin's Early Years: From Quiet Beginnings to Global Attention


After its birth and a quiet, nerdy start, Bitcoin quickly gained notoriety beginning in February 2011 with the launch of the Silk Road, a decentralized online marketplace that used bitcoin as its sole means of payment. This association with the sale of illicit goods, which was first widely publicized by a Gawker article in June 2011, gave Bitcoin its initial "dark reputation." The Gawker article caused the first significant spike in Google searches for Bitcoin and briefly drove its price from about $10 to $30. A much larger surge in interest and price occurred in the spring of 2013, when the price jumped from roughly $30 to $230. This demand is often linked to the financial crisis and bank bailout in Cyprus, which highlighted Bitcoin's appeal as a digital asset outside of government control and led to it being touted as a potential "Global Economy's Last Safe Haven" by Bloomberg. This period in 2013 served as a prelude to Bitcoin's true grand opening to global attention, which was set to happen six months later in November.
