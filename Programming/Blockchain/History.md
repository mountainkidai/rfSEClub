## FINANICIAL CRISES 2008

         The slumpling Household Market

 The 2008 financial crisis started as a slowly unfolding nightmare for major financial institutions. A key event was the collapse of Bear Stearns, a major Wall Street firm, which was bought by JPMorgan Chase & Co. for a fraction of its former value with the Federal Reserve's help. The crisis was fueled by a practice known as subprime lending, where banks issued high-risk mortgage loans to people who couldn't afford to repay them. These loans were then packaged and sold as complex securities called collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), spreading the risk throughout the financial system.
