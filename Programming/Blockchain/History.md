## FINANICIAL CRISES 2008

         The slumpling Household Market

The 2008 financial crisis started as a slowly unfolding nightmare for major financial institutions. A key event was the collapse of Bear Stearns, a major Wall Street firm, which was bought by JPMorgan Chase & Co. for a fraction of its former value with the Federal Reserve's help. The crisis was fueled by a practice known as subprime lending, where banks issued high-risk mortgage loans to people who couldn't afford to repay them. These loans were then packaged and sold as complex securities called collateralized mortgage obligation (CMOs), spreading the risk throughout the financial system.

 This caused the next domino, Lehman Brothers, to collapse because it owned many of those risky loans and the value of its assets dropped to almost nothing.
​When Lehman Brothers fell, it owed money to many other banks and companies around the world. So, its collapse knocked over the next dominoes like Merrill Lynch and AIG, which were also very close to failing.

         The Birth Of Bitcoin

 Bitcoin's creator :a person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto, came up with the idea for Bitcoin during the peak of the 2008 financial crisis. While Wall Street was falling apart, Satoshi was working on a brand new kind of money system.

##### The Problem: The financial crisis showed that the traditional banking system was flawed. It relied on a lot of trust and was very centralized, meaning a       few  big  institutions held all the power and could make risky decisions that hurt everyone else.

#####   The Solution: Satoshi created Bitcoin as a way to have electronic transactions without relying on trust. In his own words, he "proposed a system for electronic   transactions without relying on trust."

#####   The Timing: The timing of Bitcoin's creation wasn't a coincidence. Satoshi started working on the idea in late 2006 and began coding in 2007, right when financial regulators were getting worried about the housing market.

Satoshi wasn't trying to just make a better bank; he was trying to create an alternative to the entire system.
Freedom from Control: Satoshi saw that governments could easily shut down centrally controlled networks, like the music-sharing site Napster. He believed that a "pure P2P network" (peer-to-peer), where every computer is connected directly to every other computer, would be much harder to control.

##### Decentralized: This means there's no single leader or central authority. The power is spread out among everyone using the network. This was a core principle of Bitcoin from the very beginning.

##### A Message for the Future

When Satoshi created the very first block of Bitcoin's digital ledger (the blockchain), he included a special message.
He inscribed: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout of banks."
This was a headline from a newspaper article about the British government likely having to rescue more banks.
By putting this message on the blockchain, Satoshi made it permanent and unchangeable. It was a clear statement to the world about why Bitcoin was needed: to be a transparent and secure alternative to a financial system that required huge government bailouts to stay afloat. It was his way of saying, "Let's not forget what happened and let's not let it happen again."  
Now it's the time to differentiate between Bitcoin and Blockchain.The world of Bitcoin can seem full of confusing jargon, but it really comes down to a few basic ideas. To keep it simple, remember the difference between the software, the money, and the record book:

#### Bitcoin (Capital 'B'): This refers to the software and the global network that makes the system run. It is the technology or the system.

#### Bitcoin (lowercase 'b'): This is the currency or the actual digital money that is sent and stored. It is the money itself.

#### Bitcoin's Blockchain: This is the public record book (a digital ledger) that records every single bitcoin transaction. It's shared across the entire network and cannot be changed, ensuring all records are safe and transparent.

#### Blockchain Technology: This is the general term for the underlying invention—the idea of using a secure, shared digital ledger (like Bitcoin's) to record any kind of data, not just money.

Bitcoin is critical because it was the first and most successful use of blockchain technology, showing the world that a decentralized system could work. To truly understand it, you must move beyond the simple idea that it is just a "shadowy system" and see it as a powerful new method for securing and transferring value.
