## FINANICIAL CRISES 2008

         The slumpling Household Market

The 2008 financial crisis started as a slowly unfolding nightmare for major financial institutions. A key event was the collapse of Bear Stearns, a major Wall Street firm, which was bought by JPMorgan Chase & Co. for a fraction of its former value with the Federal Reserve's help. The crisis was fueled by a practice known as subprime lending, where banks issued high-risk mortgage loans to people who couldn't afford to repay them. These loans were then packaged and sold as complex securities called collateralized mortgage obligation (CMOs), spreading the risk throughout the financial system.Therefore

This caused the next domino, Lehman Brothers, to collapse because it owned many of those risky loans and the value of its assets dropped to almost nothing.
â€‹When Lehman Brothers fell, it owed money to many other banks and companies around the world. So, its collapse knocked over the next dominoes like Merrill Lynch and AIG, which were also very close to failing.

         The Birth Of Bitcoin

 Bitcoin's creator :a person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto, came up with the idea for Bitcoin during the peak of the 2008 financial crisis. While Wall Street was falling apart, Satoshi was working on a brand new kind of money system.

##### The Problem: The financial crisis showed that the traditional banking system was flawed. It relied on a lot of trust and was very centralized, meaning a       few  big  institutions held all the power and could make risky decisions that hurt everyone else.

#####   The Solution: Satoshi created Bitcoin as a way to have electronic transactions without relying on trust. In his own words, he "proposed a system for electronic   transactions without relying on trust."

#####   The Timing: The timing of Bitcoin's creation wasn't a coincidence. Satoshi started working on the idea in late 2006 and began coding in 2007, right when financial regulators were getting worried about the housing market.

Satoshi wasn't trying to just make a better bank; he was trying to create an alternative to the entire system.
Freedom from Control: Satoshi saw that governments could easily shut down centrally controlled networks, like the music-sharing site Napster. He believed that a "pure P2P network" (peer-to-peer), where every computer is connected directly to every other computer, would be much harder to control.

##### Decentralized: This means there's no single leader or central authority. The power is spread out among everyone using the network. This was a core principle of Bitcoin from the very beginning.

##### A Message for the Future

When Satoshi created the very first block of Bitcoin's digital ledger (the blockchain), he included a special message.
He inscribed: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout of banks."
This was a headline from a newspaper article about the British government likely having to rescue more banks.
By putting this message on the blockchain, Satoshi made it permanent and unchangeable. It was a clear statement to the world about why Bitcoin was needed: to be a transparent and secure alternative to a financial system that required huge government bailouts to stay afloat. It was his way of saying, "Let's not forget what happened and let's not let it happen again."  

        An Alternative Financial System

Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin as an alternative financial system based on cryptographic proof, not trust, making it fully decentralized and free from central authorities. This was a deliberate response to the failings of the existing system. In its infancy, however, Satoshi showed concern for the network's fragility, notably pleading with WikiLeaks on December 5, 2010, not to accept Bitcoin donations, fearing the sudden "heat" and attention would "destroy" the small project. Shortly afterward, Satoshi vanished, which is widely seen as a deliberate move to eliminate a single point of failure and ensure Bitcoin's long-term survival through true decentralization, allowing it to be governed by a network of thousands. This free, open-source birth starkly contrasted with the  $2.5 trillion-dollar cost of the Wall Street bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis, whose instability ironically helped foster the community that allowed Bitcoin to grow. 

      Welcome to the world that bitcoin created

 Since Satoshi disappeared, Bitcoin has unleashed a tidal wave of disruption and rethinking of global financial and technological systems. Countless deri-vation of Bitcoin have been created-systems such as Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, and Zcash-all of which rely on blockchain technology, Satoshi's gift to the world. At the same time, many financial and technological incumbents have moved to embrace the technology, creating confusion around all the innovation unfolding and what is most relevant to the innovative investor. The next chapter will involve solidifying understanding of blockchain technology, Bitcoin, bitcoin, cryptoassets, and where the investment opportunities await
