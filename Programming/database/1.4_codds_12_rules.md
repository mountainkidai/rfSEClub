Codd's 12 Rules, published in 1985 by Edgar F. Codd, define the strict criteria for a system to qualify as a true relational database management system (RDBMS).

Rule 0: Foundation Rule
The system must use its relational facilities exclusively to manage the database—no external tools or hacks.

Principle: Self-contained relational power.

Example: SQL alone defines tables, queries Loans JOIN Books, and enforces keys; no file-system bypass.
​

Rule 1: Information Rule

All information—data values, table names, column types—resides in tables; no other formats like files or hierarchies.

Principle: Uniform representation.

Example: Query INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS to list Books' structure like any data table.
​

Rule 2: Guaranteed Access Rule

Every atomic value is accessible via table name + primary key + column name.

Principle: Predictable addressing without scans.

Example: SELECT title FROM Books WHERE id = 1 fetches exact value—no offsets or indices exposed.
​

Rule 3: Systematic Treatment of Null Values

Nulls represent missing/unknown data consistently, not blanks or specials; operations propagate them predictably.

Principle: Handle absence uniformly.

```text
| loan_id | book_id | borrower | return_date |
| ------- | ------- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1       | 101     | Alice    | NULL        |
| 2       | 102     | Bob      | 2026-01-10  |
```

Example: SELECT \* FROM Loans WHERE return_date IS NULL finds overdue books safely.
​

Rule 4: Active Online Catalog Based on the Relational Model
The catalog (metadata) is a queryable relational database itself.
Principle: Metadata as data.
Example: SELECT table_name FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE' lists Books, Authors.
​

Rule 5: Comprehensive Data Sublanguage Rule
One language (e.g., SQL) handles data definition, manipulation, views, integrity, authorization, and transactions.
Principle: Unified interface.
Example: CREATE TABLE Books (...); INSERT INTO Books VALUES (...); GRANT SELECT ON Books TO user; all in SQL.
​

Rule 6: View Updating Rule
All theoretically updatable views support INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE as if they were base tables.
Principle: Transparent abstraction.
Example: CREATE VIEW TolkienBooks AS SELECT \* FROM Books JOIN Authors ON author_id = id WHERE name = 'Tolkien'; INSERT INTO TolkienBooks (title) VALUES ('Silmarillion'); adds to Books.
​

Rule 7: High-Level Insert, Update, and Delete
Operations target sets of rows, not record-at-a-time.
Principle: Relational algebra (multi-row sets).
Example: UPDATE Loans SET status = 'returned' WHERE return_date IS NOT NULL; batches changes.
​

Rule 8: Physical Data Independence
Changes to storage (files, indexes, disks) do not affect application queries.
Principle: Logical ops hide hardware.
Example: Optimizer swaps B-tree for hash index on author_id; JOIN query unchanged.
​

Rule 9: Logical Data Independence
Schema changes (add/remove columns, split tables) preserve external views.
Principle: Stable interfaces.
Example: Add isbn to Books; old SELECT title FROM Books views unaffected via mapping.
​

Rule 10: Integrity Independence
All constraints (primary/foreign keys, check rules) are stored in the catalog and enforced by the DBMS.
Principle: Centralized rules.
Example: ALTER TABLE Books ADD CONSTRAINT fk_author FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES Authors(id);—auto-checked, no app code.
​

Rule 11: Distribution Independence
Users see unified data whether centralized or sharded across servers.
Principle: Transparent scale.
Example: SELECT \* FROM Loans JOIN Books works if Loans on server A, Books on B.
​

Rule 12: Nonsubversion Rule
Low-level interfaces (if any) cannot bypass higher-level relational constraints.
Principle: No integrity leaks.
Example: Even record-level APIs enforce NOT NULL on primary keys—no raw writes allowed.
​

Why These Rules Matter
Few commercial RDBMS fully comply (e.g., view updating is hard), but they guide design for reliability and portability. In Rust, libraries like Diesel enforce these via type-safe queries, mirroring Codd's purity for top-tier systems. Build relations from sets: every table a predicate, rows its truths.
