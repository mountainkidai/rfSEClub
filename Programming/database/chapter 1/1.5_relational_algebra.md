Relational Algebra = SQL's mathematical blueprint (Codd 1970). These 5 operations are the core foundation every database must implement.
​

### The 5 Essential Operations:

1. Selection (σ) → WHERE clause

```sql
σ_age>25(Users) = SELECT * FROM Users WHERE age > 25
Filters ROWS based on condition
```

```text
Math: {t | t ∈ Users ∧ t.age > 25}

"Give me every tuple t
 that belongs to Users
 and has age greater than 25"
```

2. Projection (π) → SELECT columns

```sql
π_name,email(Users) = SELECT name, email FROM Users
Picks COLUMNS, removes duplicates automatically
```

```text
{t[name,email] | t ∈ Users}

"Take EVERY row t from Users, KEEP ONLY name+email columns"
```

3. Join (⨝) → Table relationships

```sql
Users ⨝_{Users.id=Orders.user_id} Orders
= SELECT * FROM Users JOIN Orders ON Users.id = Orders.user_id
Combines tables on matching values
```

```text
{t | t₁ ∈ Users ∧ t₂ ∈ Orders ∧ t₁.id = t₂.user_id}
"Take tuple t where t₁ from Users AND t₂ from Orders AND their ids match"

```

4. Union (∪) → Merge tables

```sql
ActiveUsers ∪ InactiveUsers = SELECT * FROM ActiveUsers UNION SELECT * FROM InactiveUsers
All rows from both, no duplicates
```

```text
Math: ActiveUsers ∪ InactiveUsers
```

5. Difference (−) → EXCEPT/MINUS

```sql
PremiumUsers − FreeUsers = SELECT * FROM PremiumUsers EXCEPT SELECT * FROM FreeUsers
Rows in first but NOT second
```

```text
Math: {t | t ∈ PremiumUsers ∧ t ∉ FreeUsers}
"Take tuple t from PremiumUsers where t is NOT in FreeUsers"

```

```sql
Find "Active premium customers in NYC who haven't ordered this month"

π_name,email(
  σ_city='NYC'(
    σ_status='premium'(
      ActiveUsers − RecentOrders
    ) ⨝_{ActiveUsers.id=Customers.id} Customers
  )
)
```
