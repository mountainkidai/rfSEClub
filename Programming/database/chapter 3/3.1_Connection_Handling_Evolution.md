### The Problem: Single Process Bottleneck

```text
1970: System R (IBM prototype)
1 App → 1 Database Process
No other apps allowed!
```

```text
App1: "SELECT * FROM users"  ← Takes 2 seconds
App2: ⏳ WAITING in queue...
App3: ⏳ WAITING in queue...
```

### Bank Teller Analogy

```text
🏦 Single Teller Window
Customer1: "Deposit ₹1000" ← Teller busy 30s
Customer2: ⏳ Standing in line
Customer3: ⏳ Standing in line

Speed = 1 customer per minute 😭
```
