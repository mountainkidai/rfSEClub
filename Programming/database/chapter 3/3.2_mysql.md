## MySQL: Multi-Teller Shared Kitchen 🏠👥

Big Improvement: Multiple Workers!

```text
MySQL (1995+): 1 App → 1 Thread (up to 50K!)
App1 → Thread1
App2 → Thread2
App3 → Thread3
```

```text
🏦 5 Teller Windows (Threads)
Customer1 → Teller1: "Deposit" ✅ Fast!
Customer2 → Teller2: "Withdraw" ✅ Fast!
Customer3 → Teller3: "Balance" ✅ Fast!
```

```text
RAM: 5000 threads = ~400MB (cheap!)
```

## MySQL 8.0+: Thread Pool (Smart Manager)

```text
Traditional: 5000 threads = chaos 😵
Thread Pool: 128 threads + TASK QUEUE 📋

Threads grab tasks like workers at conveyor belt
No more "5000 threads fighting for CPU"
```

```text
┌─────────────────┐
│ 128 THREADS     │  ← Fixed smart workers
│ Task Queue 📋   │  ← 5000 waiting queries
└─────────────────┘
```

### Problem

```text
RAM Efficient: 5000 conns = 400MB ✅
Stability: ONE bug = TOTAL CRASH ❌
```
