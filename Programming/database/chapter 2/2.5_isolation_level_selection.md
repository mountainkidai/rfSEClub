#### 4 Simple Rules

| Your Work                       | Use This                 | Why                            |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Read only (reports, dashboards) | Repeatable Read          | Frozen picture all transaction |
| Read + Write (normal apps)      | Read Committed (default) | Fast + safe enough             |
| Super busy app (1000 users/sec) | Read Committed           | Maximum speed                  |
| Bank/money critical             | Serializable             | Perfect order (slow)           |

```sql
-- 99% of your app (dashboards, lists)
BEGIN;  -- Read Committed (default) ⚡

-- Monthly PDF reports (1%)
BEGIN ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ; 📸

-- Money transfers (0.1%)
BEGIN ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE; 🛡️
```

#### How to decide?

- Are you just LOOKING? → Repeatable Read
- Need to CHANGE data? → Read Committed
- App crashing from traffic? → Read Committed
- Money disappearing? → Serializable
