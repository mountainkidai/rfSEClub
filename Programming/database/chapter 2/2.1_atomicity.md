### Atomicity = "All or Nothing" - Transaction as single unbreakable unit.

Bank Transfer Example:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;  -- Debit Alice
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;  -- Credit Bob

-- If EITHER fails → ROLLBACK → Both balances unchanged!
COMMIT;  -- Only if BOTH succeed

```

What Happens:

```text
✅ BOTH succeed → COMMIT → Alice -$100, Bob +$100
❌ Alice debit fails → ROLLBACK → No changes
❌ Bob credit fails → ROLLBACK → Alice unchanged
❌ Power outage → ROLLBACK → No money lost
```

How It Works:

```text

1. BEGIN → All changes in TEMP memory/log
2. COMMIT → Make permanent (write to disk)
3. ROLLBACK → Discard all changes
4. Crash? → Auto-ROLLBACK uncommitted work
```
