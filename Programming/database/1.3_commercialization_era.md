The Commercialization Era marked the shift from academic research on relational databases to real-world products businesses could buy and use. It built on first principles: data as organized tables (relations) with rows and columns, linked by keys, enabling reliable queries

## System R Prototype

IBM's System R (1974) proved relational databases work in practice. Engineers built a working system using SEQUEL (later SQL) to query data simply, validating Edgar Codd's 1970 theory that tables could replace messy file systems or hierarchical models.

## Oracle's Launch

In 1979, Larry Ellison's startup released Oracle V2, the first sellable relational DBMS (RDBMS). Named "V2" to seem mature (skipping V1), it ran SQL on everyday hardware like PDP-11, letting companies store and fetch data portably without IBM lock-in.

## Ingres Impact

UC Berkeley's Ingres (late 1970s) was an open research RDBMS using a query language called QUEL. It influenced free tools like Postgres and showed relational ideas scaled to complex apps, prioritizing data independence over hardware specifics.

## SQL Standardization

By the early 1980s, SQL became a standard (ANSI 1986), ensuring tools from different vendors interoperate. This principle—universal language for table operations (SELECT, JOIN)—drove mass adoption, as apps query any compliant database without rewrite.
