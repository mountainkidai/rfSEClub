## 2. Compound Types: Grouping Data

Compound types in Rust group multiple values into a single type, allowing you to organize related data efficiently. Understanding these types is crucial for writing well-structured, maintainable Rust code and becoming proficient in the language.

### Types

Compound Types

1. Primitive Compound Types (Built-in):​

   1. [Tuples](https://www.rfse.club/#opensource/Programming/rust/content/004a_tuples.md)
   2. [Arrays](https://www.rfse.club/#opensource/Programming/rust/content/004b_arrays.md)

2. User-Defined Compound Types:​

   1. [Structs](https://www.rfse.club/#opensource/Programming/rust/content/004c_structs.md)
   2. [Enums](https://www.rfse.club/#opensource/Programming/rust/content/004d_enums.md)

3. Standard Library Compound Types:​

   1. [Vectors](https://www.rfse.club/#opensource/Programming/rust/content/004e_vectors.md)
   2. [Slices &[T]](https://www.rfse.club/#opensource/Programming/rust/content/004f_slices.md)
   3. [Strings (String, &str)](https://www.rfse.club/#opensource/Programming/rust/content/004g_strings.md)

4. C-Compatible Union Type:​

   1. [Unions (union)](https://www.rfse.club/#opensource/Programming/rust/content/004h_unions.md)

## Problems

1. Create a tuple containing a name (string), age (number), and active status (boolean), then print all three values
2. Create an array of 5 integers, access the first and last elements, and print them
3. Create a struct with at least two fields, instantiate it, and print the field values
4. Create an enum with at least three variants, create an instance of one variant, and use match to handle it
5. Create a vector, add three elements to it, and print all elements using a loop.
