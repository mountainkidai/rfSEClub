## Constants and Their Declaration

Constants are declared using `const` keyword and must include type annotation.

```rust
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;

println!("The maximum points are: {}", MAX_POINTS);
```

Constants are always immutable and are accessible throughout the entire program.

Constants are conventionally written in uppercase with underscores. They are handy for fixed values you want available everywhere.
