## Network Protocols

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

When: Early 1970s

What: A protocol ensuring reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between devices over a network.

Simple: Like a phone call where both ends confirm messages so nothing is lost or out of order.

Use: Forms the base for most internet communications (HTTP, SMTP, FTP).

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

When: Early 1980s

What: A lightweight, connectionless protocol for sending packets without guarantees.

Simple: Like sending letters in the mail without expecting confirmation of receipt.

Use: Useful when speed matters more than reliability, e.g., live video, gaming.

### TLS (Transport Layer Security)

When: Late 1990s (originally SSL in mid-1990s)

What: Security protocol that encrypts TCP communication to ensure privacy and authenticity.

Simple: Like locking phone conversations so only the receiver can understand.

Use: Secure web browsing (HTTPS), secure APIs.

### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

When: Early 1990s

What: The protocol for transmitting web content, built on top of TCP.

Simple: A set of rules for web browsers and servers to exchange webpages.

Use: Basis of the web, REST APIs.

### WebSocket

When: 2011

What: A protocol that upgrades HTTP connections to a persistent, bidirectional communication channel.

Simple: Like a direct phone line that stays open for both sides to talk any time.

Use: Real-time apps like chat, live data feeds.

### Summary Chronology

TCP: Reliable network communication foundation.

UDP: Lightweight network communication for speed.

TLS: Secured communication via encryption.

HTTP: Structured communication for the web.

WebSocket: Real-time, low-latency two-way communication.
