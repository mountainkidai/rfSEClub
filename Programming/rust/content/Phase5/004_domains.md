Who Owns Domains? (Simple Hierarchy)

### Domain Ownership Chain

```text
You buy "mywebsite.com" → **YOU own it** (registrant)

↓ Pay yearly fee to:
**GoDaddy** (registrar) ← **Sells domains to you**

↓ GoDaddy pays/works with:
**Verisign** (registry) ← Owns **.com** database

↓ Verisign reports to:
**ICANN** ← Global boss (coordinates all TLDs like .com, .org)

↓ ICANN coordinates:
**IANA** ← Master database (roots of DNS tree)
```

Visual Chain

```text
You ("mywebsite.com" owner)
↓ Yearly payment
GoDaddy (Registrar = domain seller)
↓ Registry fee
Verisign (.com Registry = .com database)
↓ Reports to
ICANN (Global coordinator)
↓ Oversees
IANA (Root database)
```

```text
**Google DNS** (8.8.8.8) = **public phonebook**

- Google runs DNS servers
- Anyone can use (free, fast)

**GoDaddy** = **domain store**

- Sells domains (.com, .net)
- Runs **their own DNS** servers (slow)

**Your choice:**

1. Use GoDaddy DNS (slow)
2. Point to Google DNS 8.8.8.8 (fast)
```
