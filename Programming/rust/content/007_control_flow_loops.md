### Loops

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    while count < 5 {
        println!("Count: {}", count);
        count += 1;
    }
}

```

## Problems

1. Write a program that uses a `while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10
2. Write a program that uses a `for` loop to iterate over an array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and print each element
3. Write a program that uses a loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 and print the result
4. Write a program that uses a `for` loop with range `1..=5` to print the multiplication table of 5
5. Write a program that uses a loop to find and print the first 5 even numbers starting from 2.
