## Summary

- Variables are immutable by default; use `mut` to allow mutation.
- Constants use `const` and must include a type annotation; they are immutable and globally accessible.
- Shadowing lets you reuse variable names with new values or types.
- Explicit type annotations help control data size and behavior.

This concludes your introduction to variables and mutability. Next, you will explore Rust’s scalar data types in detail.
