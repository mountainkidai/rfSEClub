### Understanding Memory in Programming from First Principles

## What is a type?

- A type defines what kind of data a value represents and what operations can be performed on it.

- Types give structure and meaning to data, helping the compiler catch errors and organize memory.

## Scalar Types

- Scalar types represent a single value.
- Imagine your data as items in boxes. Each box has a label:
- "Integer
  - Whole numbers without decimals.
- Floating-Point Numbers
  - Numbers with decimals.
- Booleans
  - Represent true or false.
- Characters

  - Represent a single Unicode scalar value.

## Compound types:

- Structs (custom data types grouping multiple values)
- Enums (types with variants)
- Arrays and tuples (fixed collections of values)
