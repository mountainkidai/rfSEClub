## Program Structure in C

### Anatomy of a C Program

- **`main` function:** The entry point where execution begins. Every C program must have exactly one `main` function.
- **Variables:** Used to store data that the program manipulates.
- **`#include` headers:** Preprocessor directives that include standard libraries providing functions like `printf`.
- **`.c` convention:** C source code files typically use the `.c` file extension.

### Tools for Writing C Code

- Use a text editor like `vi`.
  - Press `i` to enter insert mode.
  - Write code.
  - Press `Esc`, then type `:wq` to save and quit.
- Verify file creation using `ls` to list files.

### Exercise: Create, Compile, and Run a Program

1. Write a simple program in `vim`.
2. Save the file with `.c` extension.
3. Compile the program using a C compiler, e.g., `gcc program.c -o program`.
4. Run the compiled executable, e.g., `./program`.
