## 3. Atoms, Molecules & Compounds (1803 Dalton’s Atomic Theory)

### 3.1 Atoms and Subatomic Particles

- **Atom**

  - Small particle made of a **nucleus** and electrons around it.
  - **Nucleus:**
    - The dense center with protons and neutrons.
    - Almost all the mass is here.

- **Subatomic Particles:**
  - **Proton:** Positive charge (+1), in nucleus.
  - **Neutron:** Neutral (0 charge), in nucleus.
  - **Electron:** Negative charge (-1), orbits nucleus.

### 3.2 Elements

- **Element**
  - Made of only one kind of **atom**.
  - Atoms have the same number of protons (atomic number).
  - Cannot be broken into simpler substances by chemical reactions.
  - **Examples:**
    - Hydrogen (H) atoms have 1 proton.
    - Oxygen (O) atoms have 8 protons.

### 3.3 Molecules vs. Compounds

- **Molecule**

  - Two or more atoms joined together.
  - Atoms can be same (O₂) or different (H₂O).

- **Compound**
  - A molecule made of different elements in a fixed ratio.
  - **Examples:**
    - Water (H₂O): 2 hydrogen + 1 oxygen atoms.
    - Salt (NaCl): 1 sodium + 1 chlorine atom.

### 3.4 Chemical Bonding Basics (Ionic vs. Covalent)

- **Ionic Bond**

  - One atom **gives** electrons, another **takes** electrons.
  - Creates charged ions that stick together.

  - **Example: Sodium Chloride (NaCl)**
    - Sodium: 11 protons, 11 electrons (2, 8, 1).

  #### What Does "2 8 1" Mean in Electron Configuration?

  - The numbers represent how electrons are arranged in an atom's shells (energy levels).
  - Each number shows how many electrons are in each shell, starting from the closest to the nucleus.

    For Sodium (Na):

  - "2" electrons in the 1st shell (closest to nucleus)
  - "8" electrons in the 2nd shell
  - "1" electron in the 3rd (outermost) shell

    ### Why It Matters

    - The outermost shell (valence shell) determines chemical properties.
    - Sodium has 1 electron in its outer shell, which it can easily lose to become stable.
    - This is why sodium often forms positive ions (Na⁺).

  - Sodium loses 1 electron → becomes Na⁺ ion (positive).
  - Chlorine: 17 protons, 17 electrons (2, 8, 7).
  - Chlorine gains 1 electron → becomes Cl⁻ ion (negative).
  - Na⁺ and Cl⁻ attract to form NaCl.

- **Covalent Bond**

  - Atoms **share** electrons with each other.
  - This sharing keeps the atoms stuck together.
  - In a hydrogen molecule (H₂), each hydrogen atom has 1 electron.
  - Instead of each electron staying only around its own atom, the two atoms **share their electrons**.
  - The shared electrons move around both atoms together.
  - This sharing makes both hydrogen atoms more stable because they behave like they each have 2 electrons in their outer shell.
  - The bond created by this sharing is called a **covalent bond**.

  - **Example: Hydrogen gas (H₂)**
    - Two hydrogen atoms each share one electron.
    - Together, they have two shared electrons, making a strong bond.
    - This makes a stable H₂ molecule.

### Summary

- **Ionic bond:** One atom gives electrons to another, like sodium giving one electron to chlorine forming charged ions that stick together.
- **Covalent bond:** Atoms share electrons so both can be stable, like two hydrogen atoms sharing electrons to form H₂ molecule.

- An **atom** is the smallest part of an element.
- An **element** is made of one kind of atom.
- A **molecule** is atoms bonded together.
- A **compound** is a molecule of different elements.
- Atoms bond by **transferring** (ionic) or **sharing** electrons (covalent).
