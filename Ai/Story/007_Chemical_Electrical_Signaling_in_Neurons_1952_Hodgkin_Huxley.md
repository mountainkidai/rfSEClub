## 7. Chemical & Electrical Signaling in Neurons (1952 Hodgkin–Huxley)

### 7.1 Neurotransmitter Release and Synapse

- Neurons communicate at junctions called **synapses**, where the axon terminal of one neuron meets the dendrites of another.
- When an **action potential** reaches the axon terminal, it triggers the release of **neurotransmitters** stored in vesicles.
- These neurotransmitters cross the **synaptic cleft** (the small gap between neurons) and bind to **receptors** on the postsynaptic neuron.
- Binding opens **ligand-gated ion channels**, allowing ions to flow in or out, changing the electrical state of the receiving neuron and possibly triggering a new action potential.

### 7.2 Ion Flow Equations (\(I = g(V - E)\))

- The flow of ions (electric current \(I\)) through channels is described by:

\[
I = g(V - E)
\]

where:

- \(I\) = ion current through the channel
- \(g\) = conductance (how open the channel is)
- \(V\) = membrane potential (voltage across the membrane)
- \(E\) = equilibrium potential of the ion (voltage where no net flow occurs)

- This equation captures how ion flow depends on both how many channels are open and the difference between the membrane voltage and the ion’s equilibrium voltage.

### 7.3 Action Potential Phases and Hodgkin–Huxley Model

- The **Hodgkin–Huxley model** mathematically describes how **voltage-gated sodium (Na⁺)** and **potassium (K⁺)** channels open and close during an action potential.
- Key phases of the action potential:

  1. **Depolarization:** Voltage-gated Na⁺ channels open rapidly, Na⁺ rushes in, membrane potential rises.
  2. **Repolarization:** Na⁺ channels close, K⁺ channels open, K⁺ flows out, membrane potential falls.
  3. **Hyperpolarization:** K⁺ channels stay open briefly, membrane potential dips below resting.
  4. **Return to Resting Potential:** K⁺ channels close, pump restores ion balance.

- Hodgkin and Huxley developed equations that predict the timing and shape of these events based on voltage and time-dependent conductance changes.
- Their model was a groundbreaking quantitative description of the biophysical basis of nerve signal transmission.
