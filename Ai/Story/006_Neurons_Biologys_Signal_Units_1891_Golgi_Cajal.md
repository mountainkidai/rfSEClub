## 6. Neurons: Biology’s Signal Units (1891 Golgi & Cajal)

### 6.1 Neuron Anatomy: Dendrites, Soma, Axon, Myelin

![Neuron Structure](images/neuron.png)

- Neurons are special cells that send messages in your body.
- They have parts like:

- **Dendrites:** Branch-like structures extending from the neuron, designed to receive most of the incoming information in the form of chemical signals called neurotransmitters from other neurons. They have receptors that pick up these signals and convert them into electrical changes.
- **Soma (Cell Body):** Contains the nucleus, which holds the DNA (genetic material). The soma integrates all the electrical signals received by the dendrites at a special region called the **axon hillock**. If the combined signal is strong enough, it triggers the next step in the neuron.
- **Axon:** A long fiber that transmits the electrical signal, now called an **action potential**, away from the soma towards other neurons or muscle cells.
- **Myelin:** A fatty, insulating material that wraps around the axon. It prevents the electrical signal from degrading and speeds up its transmission, allowing signals to travel quickly and efficiently along the axon.

This architecture allows neurons to process and pass on information rapidly throughout the nervous system, forming the basis for all neural communication.

### 6.2 The Membrane: Lipid Bilayer and Ion Channels

- The neuron's **membrane** is a **phospholipid bilayer** with embedded protein pores known as **ion channels**.
- These ion channels act as tiny doors controlling the passage of charged particles (ions) like sodium (Na⁺), potassium (K⁺), calcium (Ca²⁺), and chloride (Cl⁻).
- Ion channels are classified based on how they open:
  - **Ligand-gated channels:** Open when specific chemicals (ligands), such as neurotransmitters, bind to them.
  - **Voltage-gated channels:** Open or close in response to changes in the electrical voltage across the membrane.
- Some channels are selective for particular ions:
  - **Potassium channels:** Allow potassium ions (K⁺) to flow out of the neuron.
  - **Sodium channels:** Allow sodium ions (Na⁺) to flow into the neuron during firing.
- These channels regulate ion movement, altering the neuron's electrical charge to enable signal transmission.

### 6.3 Resting Membrane Potential (\(\approx -70\) mV) - Clear Explanation

- The **resting membrane potential** is the electrical voltage difference across the neuron's membrane when it is **not actively sending signals.**
- Typically, this voltage is about **-70 millivolts (mV)**, meaning the **inside of the neuron is negative** compared to the outside.

#### Why does this happen?

- **Ion concentrations differ inside and outside the neuron:**

  - Inside: high concentration of **potassium ions (K⁺)** and negatively charged **organic anions (A⁻)** that cannot leave the cell (e.g., proteins and amino acids).
  - Outside: high concentration of **sodium ions (Na⁺)** and **chloride ions (Cl⁻)**.

- **Selective permeability:**

  - The membrane is **more permeable to potassium (K⁺)** than sodium (Na⁺), so potassium ions can **leak out** of the neuron through potassium channels.
  - Positively charged potassium ions leaving the cell make the inside more negative because negatively charged molecules inside cannot follow.

- **Sodium-potassium pump:**
  - Uses energy (ATP) to pump **3 sodium ions out** and **2 potassium ions in**, maintaining ion gradients and keeping the inside negative.

#### Result

- The combined effect of ion concentration differences, membrane permeability, and active pumping results in a steady membrane voltage around **-70 mV**.
- This voltage acts like a **charged battery**, keeping the neuron ready to send signals quickly when triggered.

**Additional facts:**

- **1 volt (V) = 1000 millivolts (mV)**
- A resting membrane potential of −70 mV means the inside is negative by about 0.07 volts.
- This small voltage difference is crucial because it allows the neuron to send electrical signals quickly when it needs to.

### 6.4 Threshold and Firing (\(-55\) mV Trigger)

- Neurons have a resting membrane potential of about **−70 mV**, meaning the inside of the cell is negative compared to the outside.

- When the sum of incoming signals causes the membrane voltage to rise towards **−55 mV**, this value is called the **threshold**.

- If the membrane voltage reaches this threshold, it triggers a sequence of events leading to an **action potential** (the neuron "fires"):

  1. **Voltage-gated sodium channels open** rapidly, allowing Na⁺ ions to flood inside.
  2. This sudden influx of positive ions causes rapid **depolarization**—the membrane voltage quickly rises to a positive value (up to +30 to +40 mV).
  3. After a brief peak, sodium channels close, and **voltage-gated potassium channels open**, allowing K⁺ ions to exit.
  4. The outflow of potassium ions causes **repolarization**, bringing the membrane potential back down toward the resting level.
  5. Sometimes the membrane voltage briefly dips below the resting potential, a phase called **hyperpolarization**.
  6. Finally, the neuron returns to its normal resting membrane state, ready to fire again if stimulated.

- This action potential travels along the axon as an electrical signal, enabling rapid communication between neurons or to muscle cells.

- If the membrane potential doesn’t reach the threshold, the neuron remains at rest—this all-or-none principle ensures that neurons only fire when sufficiently stimulated.

This mechanism, involving the critical threshold and rapid ion channel changes, forms the basis of how neurons transmit information electrically.

## Summary: Everything So Far We Discussed

Imagine Steve, a curious kid who wants to understand life:

- Everything around Steve is made of tiny building blocks called **atoms** — like LEGO pieces. When these atoms stick together, they form **molecules**, kind of like combining LEGO blocks to build something bigger.
- Molecules combine in special ways to create **cells** — the smallest living units. Think of cells like tiny factories doing many jobs to keep life going.
- Each cell has a **membrane** — its smart gatekeeper that decides what comes in and goes out. This helps the cell stay safe and balanced.
- Inside the cell, special parts called **organelles** work like machines:
  - The **nucleus** is the control center with the instructions (DNA).
  - The **mitochondria** are power plants giving energy.
  - Other organelles help build proteins, move packages, and clean up waste.
- Cells use **nutrients** like carbs and fats as fuel and building material. Fats also keep animals warm by acting as insulation.
- Groups of cells called **tissues** work together like a team — for example, muscle tissue lets Steve run and jump.
- Then there are **neurons** — special cells that send signals like tiny messengers.
  - They receive messages with **dendrites**, decide what to do in the **soma**, and send signals down a long wire called the **axon**, wrapped in insulation called **myelin** to speed things up.
  - Neurons communicate using electrical changes controlled by tiny gate-like structures called **ion channels**.
  - When the neuron gets excited enough (like reaching a threshold), it sends an electrical impulse — a signal — to other neurons or muscles.

In short: Life is complex, but it starts from a few simple, well-organized building blocks — just like Steve’s favorite addition problem.
