## 5. Cells: The Units of Life (1838–1840 Cell Theory)

### 5.1 What is a Cell?

- An **atom** is the smallest unit of matter, forming the basic building blocks of everything around us.
- When atoms join together, they form **molecules**, which combine in complex ways to build living units called **cells**.
- A **cell** is the smallest unit of life that can carry out all life processes such as growth, obtaining energy, and reproduction.
- Cells reproduce by dividing into two new cells through a process called **cell division** (most commonly mitosis), where the cell copies its DNA and splits into identical daughter cells. This allows organisms to grow and repair themselves.
- Cells perform many chemical reactions inside them to get energy and build molecules they need—this set of chemical reactions is called **metabolism**.
- Metabolism includes breaking down food molecules to release energy (like glucose being converted to ATP) and building new molecules like proteins.
- A **tissue** is a group of similar cells working together for a specific job, like muscle tissue made of muscle cells.

### 5.2 Cell Membrane: The Protective Barrier

- The **cell membrane** surrounds the cell and creates a barrier between the inside of the cell and the outside environment.
- This membrane is **selectively permeable**, meaning it controls what substances can go in or out, helping keep the cell balanced.
- It is composed mainly of a **phospholipid bilayer**—two layers of phospholipids with hydrophilic heads facing out and hydrophobic tails facing in—making it flexible yet stable.
- The membrane contains proteins that assist in transporting substances and help cells communicate, maintain shape, and stick to other cells.
- It anchors the **cytoskeleton**, which supports the cell shape and helps in movement and division.

### 5.3 Biochemical Reactions and Organelles in Cells

- Inside cells are small structures called **organelles**, each with specific jobs to keep the cell alive.
- For example:
  - The **nucleus** holds DNA and acts as the cell's control center.
  - **Mitochondria** are the powerhouses where metabolism mainly happens; they produce energy (ATP) by breaking down food molecules through cellular respiration.
  - **Ribosomes** make proteins needed for cell functions.
  - The **endoplasmic reticulum (ER)** helps make and transport proteins and fats.
  - The **Golgi apparatus** packages and sends out proteins and other molecules.
  - **Lysosomes** and **vacuoles** store, digest, and remove waste materials.
- Metabolism mainly happens in mitochondria but also involves other organelles and the cytoplasm.
- **Water** inside cells is crucial for biochemical reactions and helps regulate temperature and transport nutrients and waste.

### 5.4 Nutrients: Building and Fueling the Cell

- **Macronutrients** supply energy and building blocks for the cell. These include:

  - **Carbohydrates:** Sugars that provide energy the cell uses to work.
  - **Proteins:** Made of smaller units called **amino acids**. Amino acids link together like beads in a chain to form proteins.
    - There are about 20 different amino acids that combine in different orders to form thousands of proteins.
    - Proteins build parts of cells (structures) and also act as **enzymes**.
    - **Enzymes** are special proteins that speed up the chemical reactions inside cells, helping metabolism happen faster and more efficiently.
  - **Fats (lipids):** Provide energy and make up the cell membrane.
  - **Water:** Makes up a large part of the cell and is crucial for all chemical reactions and keeping the cell shape.

- **Micronutrients** like vitamins and minerals are needed in small amounts but are essential for many cell functions.
  - **Minerals** are inorganic elements, like:
    - **Calcium:** Important for strong bones and teeth.
    - **Iron:** Needed for carrying oxygen in the blood.

### 5.5 Insulation Role of Fats

- Fats also help keep organisms warm by providing insulation to reduce heat loss through the skin.
