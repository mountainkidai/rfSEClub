## 2. What Is Matter? (Ancient–17th Century)

### 2.1 Defining Matter: Mass and Volume

Matter is anything that has

- **mass** (how much "stuff" it contains) and
- **volume** (how much space it takes up).

- Mass is measured in kilograms (kg) or grams (g).
- Volume is measured in liters (L), milliliters (mL), or cubic meters (m³).

#### What Is a Particle?

A **particle** is a tiny piece of matter. In solids, liquids, and gases, these particles can be:

- **Atoms** (like individual oxygen or gold atoms)
- **Molecules** (like water molecules made of hydrogen + oxygen)

Particles make up everything we see.

### 2.2 Atomic Particles: Protons, Neutrons, Electrons, and Nucleus

- **Proton**

  - A **subatomic particle** with a positive charge (+1).
  - Located in the **nucleus** (center) of an atom.

- **Neutron**

  - A **subatomic particle** with **no charge** (0).
  - Also located in the **nucleus** alongside protons.

- **Electron**

  - A **subatomic particle** with a negative charge (−1).
  - Orbits the nucleus in regions called **electron shells**.

- **Nucleus**
  - The **dense core** of the atom, containing protons and neutrons.
  - Nearly all the atom's mass is in the nucleus.

#### Counting Particles in Atoms

- **In a neutral atom**: Number of **protons** = Number of **electrons**
- **Atomic number (Z)**: The number of protons in an atom (defines the element)
- **Mass number (A)**: Total number of protons + neutrons
- **Number of neutrons** = Mass number − Atomic number (A − Z)

**Example**: Carbon-12 has atomic number 6, mass number 12

- Protons: 6
- Electrons: 6 (same as protons in neutral atom)
- Neutrons: 12 − 6 = 6

### 2.3 Properties vs. Force

- **Property**

  - A characteristic or quality that helps describe or identify something.
  - Not a thing itself but a measurable or observable attribute.
  - **Example:** "Solid" and "liquid" are properties describing the state of matter.

- **Force**
  - The effect that a property (such as charge) causes on other objects.
  - **Example:** A proton's positive charge can **attract** electrons or **repel** other protons. This push or pull is the force.

### 2.4 Ion and Ionized State

- **Ion**

  - An **atom or molecule** that has an **overall electric charge** because it has **lost or gained electrons**.
  - If it **loses** an electron, it becomes a **positive ion** (cation).
  - If it **gains** an electron, it becomes a **negative ion** (anion).

- **Ionized State**
  - When a gas's atoms or molecules lose or gain electrons, it becomes **ionized**—meaning it contains free **electrons** and **ions**.
  - This ionized gas is called **plasma**.

### 2.5 Static Electricity vs. Ions

Both involve electric charge imbalance, but work differently:

Atoms are normally electrically neutral because they have the same number of protons (positive charge) and electrons (negative charge).

**Static electricity** happens when atoms on the surface of an object lose or gain electrons, creating an imbalance of charge on that object's surface. The atoms themselves become imbalanced only in their outer electrons, not protons.

**Ions** are atoms or molecules that, by default, have either lost or gained electrons, so their total number of electrons is different from the number of protons inside. This gives them a permanent net electric charge until they react or regain balance.

So, static electricity is a temporary charge imbalance on surfaces due to electron movement, whereas ions are atoms or molecules with an inherent charge imbalance due to missing or extra electrons.so they have a permanent charge imbalance.

### 2.6 States of Matter: Solids, Liquids, Gases, Plasma

- **Solids**

  - Have a definite shape and volume.
  - Particles are tightly packed next to each other and **vibrate in place**—imagine people standing close together in a crowded room only shuffling their feet.

- **Liquids**

  - Have a definite volume but take the shape of their container.
  - Particles are still close but can **slide past each other**—like people in a slowly moving crowd who can weave around one another.

- **Gases**

  - Have no fixed shape or volume.
  - Particles move freely in all directions, filling whatever space is available—like people running around in a large open field.

- **Plasma**
  - An **ionized** state of matter where particles have lost or gained electrons, creating free **electrons** and **ions**.
  - Found in high-energy environments:
    - **Stars** (the Sun's core is plasma)
    - **Lightning** (the air becomes plasma when it heats up)
    - **Neon signs** (electric current turns neon gas into glowing plasma)
