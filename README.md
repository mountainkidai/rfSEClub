# rfSE Club - Round Table for Students & Engineers üåè

## What We Are

rfSE Club (Round Table for Students & Engineers) is an innovative education initiative by MountainKid Innovations Private Limited & H.P Government, based in Jakhu Hill, Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. We are revolutionizing education by deploying engineers to teach directly in schools, bypassing traditional systems and focusing on first-principles thinking. Our pilot project targets 4 schools in Himachal Pradesh, impacting 400-600 students in 10th, 11th, and 12th grades. We teach Problem Analysis, Mathematics, Programming (C, JS, Python), and Communication Skills (English - written, spoken, and soft skills), preparing students to think like engineers and solve real-world challenges.

## Who We Are

MountainKid Innovations Private Limited, led by Aariv, is a Shimla-based tech company dedicated to solving Food, Health, Tourism, and Agriculture problems using AI, Rust, and Blockchain technologies. Aariv, the Founder & CEO, brings 7 years of software development experience, having delivered projects for companies like Confitence AI (a San Francisco-based 3D-tech company), WestCoast Leather, Susanamonaco, and Sorabyrd. He also recently launched Sari beta v0.1, a health app, in 2025. Our team includes 5 engineers (4 teaching directly, with Aariv as the 5th overseeing curriculum and coding), supported by 3 mathematics teachers and 1 communication skills teacher per school, ensuring a blend of technical expertise and local context.

## Our Dream

We dream of transforming Himachal Pradesh into India‚Äôs next tech valley by 2030, making it one of the top 5 economies in the country. Through rfSE Club, we aim to empower students with first-principles thinking, equipping them to innovate, solve problems, and build a future where they can stay in Himachal and contribute to its growth. We envision a state where education fosters engineers who push human civilization forward‚Äîstarting with an open-source curriculum branded as a ‚ÄúHimachal Pradesh Education Department Initiative.‚Äù Our ultimate goal is to scale this model across Himachal, integrating advanced technologies like small language models and AR/VR-based learning, to create a sustainable, tech-driven education system that inspires the next generation of innovators.
