# rfSE Club - Radical Future Scientists and Engineers Club üåè

## What We Are

rfSE Club is an innovative education initiative by MountainKid AI with a motive to create real engineers who can invent and innovate things..

## The Problem

The current education system isn‚Äôt keeping up with advancements around the world. And it has become more of job-oriented / grade-oriented instead of focussing on innovation / inventions.

## The Solution

We are building rfSE Club to empower students with first-principles thinking, mathematics, problem analysis, and programming, equipping them to innovate/invent and solve problems.

## Current Status

At the moment, we are working actively in preparing the curriculum with quick iterations. Simultaneously we are connecting schools, colleges and individual free minded souls to Engineers at MountainKid bypassing the traditional education system. And hopefully by the end of this year, we will be releasing a virtual school software for everyone to improve the user experience.

## What's next?

our ultimate goal is to scale this model across Himachal Schools initially and expand it further across the country and the world by integrating MountainKid custom in-house language models along with AR/VR-based learning, to create a innovative, tech-driven education system that inspires the next generation of innovators.
