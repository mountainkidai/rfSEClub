## MountainKid Valley Product Dev Rules

### Define the Problem

- **Dig down to the core:**
  - **What's the problem?**
  - **Why‚Äôs it here?**
  - **What‚Äôs the real cost (cash, lives, time)?**
  - **Solution: Fix the root, not the symptoms.**
    - _Example_: Health is unaffordable because focus is on curing, not preventing‚Äîshift to proactive prevention.

### Work on the Solution

- **Break down the known facts to First Principles**
  - **Question every assumption:**
    - _What is this?_
    - _Why this?_
  - **Boil down to undeniable truths**
    - _e.g. cells need fuel, oxygen, waste out._
  - **Now create the base with undeniable truths.**
    - _Example: Physical health = 100% organ function; mental health = 100% life enjoyment._
    - _Outcome: Now we have the first list of undeniable truths or the base._

### Eliminate the unwanted things

- **Refine the base/undeniable truths:**
  - **Be ruthless and remove anything**
    - _not tied to the core problem or_
    - _not cost effective._
  - **Add a truth back only if we need it desperately.**
    - _Example: Ditch hospital dependency and generic advice; keep tailored fixes like ‚Äú2L water for kidneys._
    - _Outcome: Now we have the final list of things that we need to build the solution. and remember, Jump the curve, not slightly better product._

### Simplify, Optimize, Rebuild

- **Build the solution from the final list of truths:**
  - **Add a truth back, only if**
    - _we get stuck in development and_
    - _we need it desperately._
  - **Keep it simple, intuitive & scalable.**
  - **Not satisfied? DELETE.**
    - _Example: Sari scores organs, spots risks (e.g., ‚Äúlow vitamin D = weak bones‚Äù), prescribes fixes (e.g., ‚Äú20-min walk in the sun b/w 10AM and 12PM‚Äù lighter skin - 10 to 15 min; darker skin - 30 to 45 min)._
    - _Outcome: A perfect solution that focuses on the problem at micro level._

### Act with sense of urgency

- **Imagine today is our last day to prove our product for a 100 crores investment. Now pull yourself together, your neurons, your sensory organs, your mad passion and improve the product. Remember, a perfect solution will always have issues since we do it in an unconventional way, so iterate quickly.**
  - **One MountainKid AI engineer is equal to 4 engineers in terms of time:outcome.**
  - **Build, test, iterate‚Äîin days, not months.**
  - **Test with real people, track the issues, tweak fast and deploy.**
  - **If the task can be done in 30minutes and has a high impact, just prioritize.**
    - _Example: adding a share button on our products might get us more people._
    - _Outcome: A scrappy product but with a real solution that can become top 1% product with iterations._

### Automate, Innovate, Scale relentlessly

- **Automate**
  - **If code can replace human**
- **Innovate:**
  - **If we can jump a curve/innovate with**
    - _fewer resources,_
    - _fewer team,_
    - _and can immediately start working,_
    - _can release 30% of your idea in the next iteration_
    - _burn through nights and JUST DO IT._
  - _else:_
    - _do it either way_
    - _Add it to the futures features list._
    - _work on it everyday with 10% of extra time_
    - _Release in the next 5 iterations._
- **Scale:**
  - **Always build custom tech for**
    - _low-latency,_
    - _high-performance_
    - _scalability_
  - **Save resources:**
    - _Money:_
      - _Email and get free credits for servers/api plans,_
      - _Use free tools_
    - _Time & Manpower:_
      - _Create modules for reusability._
    - _Example: Sari automates diagnostics, scales to every home with less resources._
    - _Outcome: A great product that works as better as any product at just 1/10th of what conventional people invest and saves money to both the company and the people._

### Build with Precision and Heart

- **Every step must tie to truth‚Äî**
  - **no guesses,**
  - **no vague fixes.**
- **Build like it‚Äôs for you:**
  - _clear,_
  - _purposeful,_
  - _impactful._
- _Example: Sari predicts disease, burnout with organ/lifestyle scores, not generic BS._
- _Outcome: MountainKid Valley -- the next tech valley in the world._

### Engineer is the best reward/position one could ever get in life, cuz we get to have a chance to push the human civilization forward. some at small scale and some at larger scale, but if you zoom out, every dot is equally important

### Engineer is not a designation someone gives you, its thought process like an artist. cuz artist is the only person who can see the things which are invisible to the ordinary
