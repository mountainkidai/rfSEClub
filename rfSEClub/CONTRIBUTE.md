# Contributing to rfSE Club

Kindly read this before you proceed for contribution.

## How to Contribute

1. **Understand the Scope**
   - Contributions are limited to Markdown files (.md) containing curriculum content: concepts, code examples, or improvements to existing files.
   - Focus areas: Problem Analysis, Mathematics, Programming (C, JS, Python, Rust), Communication Skills (English - writing, speaking, leadership). (refer to the curriculum files for each subject.)
   - Content must be clear, practical, and tailored for 8th-12th grade students.

2. **Set Up the Repository**
   - Fork the repo: `https://github.com/mountainkidai/rfSEClub`.
   - Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/rfSEClub.git`.
   - Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.

3. **Make Changes**
   - Edit or create `.md` files in the appropriate directory (e.g., `curriculum/programming/`).
   - Ensure code examples are:
     - Functional and tested (e.g., run Python/Rust code locally).
     - Well-commented, with explanations for students.
     - Relevant to real-world problems (e.g., traffic solutions in Himachal).
   - Follow the curriculum’s style: concise, jargon-free, with practical applications.
   - Example structure for a new file:

     ````markdown
     # Topic: Rust Ownership

     ## Concept

     Ownership ensures memory safety in Rust...

     ## Code Example

     ```rust
     fn main() {
         let s = String::from("hello"); // s owns the string
         println!("{}", s);
     }
     ```
     ````

     ## Application

     Use ownership to manage resources in a Himachal tourism app...

     ```rust

     ```

4. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**
   - Push your branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature`.
   - Open a PR to the `dev` branch of `mountainkidai/rfSEClub`.
   - Include in the PR description:
     - Purpose of changes (e.g., “Added Python list comprehension to Programming.md”).
     - How it aligns with rfSE Club’s goals.
     - Confirmation that code examples are tested.
   - PRs require approval from `@aarivtmk`. Expect feedback within 48 hours.

5. **Quality Standards**
   - Content must align with the first-principles approach (break down concepts to their core).
   - Code must be educational, with clear comments and student-friendly explanations.
   - Avoid redundancy; check existing files before adding new content.
   - Maintain a professional tone, free of slang or unrelated topics.

6. **Code of Conduct**
   - Unresolved disputes or off-topic contributions may lead to PR rejection.
   - Respect the mission: empower students to become world-class engineers.

## Testing Contributions

- Code examples must be tested locally before submission (e.g., run `python script.py` or `cargo run` for Rust).
- If your PR includes code, ensure it passes the repo’s GitHub Actions tests (configured for linting and validation).
- For Markdown, preview files to confirm formatting (e.g., headings, code blocks) renders correctly.
