# Harvard Mark I and Grace Hopper

The **Harvard Mark I**, completed in 1944, was one of the first electromechanical computers. It marked a major step in computational design—bridging mechanical ingenuity with electronic control. Central to its legacy was **Grace Hopper**, a mathematician and naval officer who shaped not only how computers functioned but also how we program them.

Also known as the **IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator (ASCC)**, this massive machine stretched over 50 feet and weighed 5 tons.

Key features:

* Used **electromechanical relays** and rotating shafts
* Could perform addition in ~0.3 seconds and multiplication in ~6 seconds
* Controlled via **punched tape instructions**
* Could run long sequences of operations without human intervention

It was reliable and ideal for wartime calculations, especially for ballistic trajectories and engineering problems.

## Grace Hopper’s Role

**Grace Hopper** joined the Navy WAVES and was assigned to work on the Mark I. Though it was designed by Howard Aiken and built by IBM, Hopper's influence on programming began here.

Her contributions included:

* Writing the **first manual** for the Mark I
* Simplifying complex sequences of instructions
* Identifying bugs in code and introducing the idea of **“debugging”** (famously removing an actual moth from a relay)

She later went on to:

* Develop the first **compiler** (a program that translates human-readable code to machine code)
* Pioneer the creation of **COBOL**, one of the first high-level programming languages still in use today

## A Turning Point

The Mark I represented the transition from manually operated calculating devices to fully automated computing. It was a bridge from mechanical to electronic systems.

Grace Hopper’s programming foresight transformed how humans interacted with machines—from rewiring hardware to writing code.
