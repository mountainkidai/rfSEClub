# EDSAC and the Stored-Program Concept

The **Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC)**, completed in 1949, was the first practical computer to implement the **stored-program concept**. This idea revolutionized computing by allowing a machine to hold both instructions and data in memory.

Designed by **Maurice Wilkes** at the University of Cambridge, EDSAC marked a key step from experimental machines to real-world usable systems.

## What Is the Stored-Program Concept?

Earlier computers like ENIAC required physical rewiring for each new task. The stored-program model, inspired by **John von Neumann’s architecture**, simplified things by:

* Keeping both **programs and data** in **RAM**
* Allowing new instructions to be loaded via **punched tape** or similar media
* Supporting branching, loops, and modularity

This enabled software development as we know it today.

## EDSAC Design and Innovations

EDSAC used:

* **Vacuum tubes** (3,000+) for computation
* **Mercury delay lines** for memory
* A **teleprinter** for output
* A simple input method using **punched tape**

Though not the fastest, it was one of the **most reliable** computers of its time.

Its first program calculated a table of square numbers and ran on **May 6, 1949**.

## Impact and Legacy

EDSAC influenced future computers through:

* Demonstration of the **stored-program principle** in action
* Serving as a model for the first commercial computer (LEO I)
* Training some of the **first software developers**

Maurice Wilkes also introduced the idea of **subroutines**—reusable code blocks that are standard in all modern programming languages.
