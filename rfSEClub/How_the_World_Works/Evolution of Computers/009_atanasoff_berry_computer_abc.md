The **Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC)**, created in the late 1930s and early 1940s, was the **first electronic digital computer**. It introduced many innovations that would influence the design of future computers, including ENIAC.

Designed by **John Atanasoff** and **Clifford Berry** at Iowa State College, the ABC solved simultaneous linear equations—a key problem in scientific computation.

## Key Features of the ABC

Unlike previous electromechanical machines, the ABC was **purely electronic**, using **vacuum tubes** to process data instead of mechanical switches or relays.

Core innovations:

* Used **binary representation** (1s and 0s)
* Incorporated **capacitor-based memory** (regenerative memory system)
* Employed **vacuum tubes** for computation and logic
* Performed one operation at a time and had a fixed set of functions

The machine could solve systems of up to 29 equations with 29 unknowns—a remarkable feat for its time.

## Development and Recognition

Atanasoff began designing the ABC in 1937, inspired by a long car ride and dissatisfaction with mechanical calculators.

With Berry’s engineering help, they constructed a working prototype by 1942.

* The machine used **punch cards** for input/output
* Its memory used **rotating drums** with capacitors to store bits
* Never fully operational due to WWII interruptions

Although the project was abandoned and almost forgotten, its designs resurfaced decades later during a patent dispute with ENIAC developers. A court ruled in 1973 that the ABC was the first computer to use electronic logic, undermining ENIAC’s patent claims.

## Legacy

While it lacked programmability and widespread recognition at the time, the ABC introduced several critical ideas:

* Use of **binary arithmetic**
* **Separation of memory and processing**
* Reliance on **electronic circuits** rather than mechanical ones

These became cornerstones of modern computer architecture.
