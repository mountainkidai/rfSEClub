# 001 - Introduction to Computers

Computers are transformative tools that process data using hardware and software. They have changed the world, enabling innovations from smartphones to space travel. This article provides a beginner-friendly overview, diving into what computers are, their basic components, and their historical and modern significance.

## Definition and Purpose of a Computer

A computer is an electronic device that receives data (input), processes it according to a set of instructions (software), stores it, and produces output. Its main purpose is to perform complex calculations, automate repetitive tasks, store vast amounts of data, and connect systems globally.
