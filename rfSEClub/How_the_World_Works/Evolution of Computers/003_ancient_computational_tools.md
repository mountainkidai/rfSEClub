# Ancient Computational Tools

Before microchips and electric circuits, humans used ingenious mechanical devices to solve mathematical problems. These early tools laid the groundwork for modern computing, showing that computation has always been about patterns, structure, and clever design—even without electricity.

## Abacus

The **abacus** is one of the earliest tools used for arithmetic. Invented over 2,000 years ago, it consists of a wooden or metal frame with rods and sliding beads. Each bead represents a number, and by sliding them in different patterns, users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

It was widely used in Asia and parts of Europe and is still taught today to help children understand number systems and mental calculation.

## Antikythera Mechanism

Discovered in a shipwreck near the Greek island of Antikythera, this **mechanical marvel from around 150 BC** is considered the world’s first analog computer. It used a complex system of gears to predict astronomical positions and eclipses decades in advance.

The Antikythera mechanism showed not only the Greeks’ understanding of astronomy but also their mastery of gear mechanics.

## Slide Rule

The **slide rule**, invented in the 17th century, was a mechanical calculator based on logarithmic scales. It allowed engineers and scientists to perform multiplication, division, roots, logarithms, and trigonometry quickly and accurately.

Slide rules were used extensively until the 1970s when digital calculators replaced them. But during their prime, they were essential tools in major scientific projects—including the Apollo moon landing.

These ancient tools reveal that the desire to calculate, measure, and predict is deeply rooted in human nature. They also prove that **computing is not just electronic—it’s a mindset of problem-solving** that spans thousands of years.
