# Konrad Zuse’s Z3 (1941)

The Z3, developed by **Konrad Zuse** in Nazi Germany during World War II, was the **world’s first programmable, fully automatic digital computer**. While lesser known than ENIAC or Colossus, the Z3 made a foundational contribution to computing history.

## What Made the Z3 Revolutionary?

Built in 1941, the Z3 used **electromechanical relays** to perform binary arithmetic and floating-point calculations.

Key features:

* Fully **programmable via punched film tape**
* Used **binary number system** (0s and 1s)
* Could perform **loops and conditional branching**
* Consisted of **2,600 relays**, performing 5–10 operations per second

These features established the Z3 as the first practical machine that closely resembled a modern computer in architecture and logic.

## The Environment and Impact

The Z3 was built under extreme wartime conditions. Zuse received little official support and constructed much of the machine using salvaged materials. His workspace? His parents’ living room.

Despite this, the Z3:

* Was used for **aerodynamic calculations** for aircraft
* Proved that binary logic and automation could handle real-world engineering problems
* Influenced future computing pioneers, though his work remained **relatively unknown outside Germany** until later

## Zuse’s Legacy

Konrad Zuse didn’t stop with the Z3. He went on to design the **Z4**, which became the first computer sold commercially in 1950.

His theoretical work also led to:

* Proposing the first **high-level programming language**, called **Plankalkül**
* Developing a **mechanical memory model** and early ideas about compiler structures

Today, Zuse is recognized as one of the **founding figures of computing**, though he worked independently of British and American efforts.

It was a machine ahead of its time, operating with the logic and architecture we now take for granted.
