# Introducing Matrices

## What is a Matrix?

A **matrix** is a rectangular grid of numbers, arranged in **rows** and **columns**. Think of it like a spreadsheet or a table of data.

> A matrix is just a collection of numbers neatly arranged in rows and columns.

### Example of a 2x3 Matrix

```txt
Matrix A =
[ 1  2  3 ]   → Row 1
[ 4  5  6 ]   → Row 2
  ↑  ↑  ↑
 C1 C2 C3
```

* 2 rows, 3 columns
* Total 6 numbers (called **elements**)

## Matrix Notation

* Matrix **A** = $aᵢⱼ$ where:

  * **i** = row number
  * **j** = column number
* A₁₂ means: Row 1, Column 2

### Dimensions

* A matrix with *m* rows and *n* columns is called an **m×n matrix**.

  * 3×2 matrix: 3 rows, 2 columns

## Why Are Matrices Important in AI?

Matrices are essential for handling and transforming data:

* Store **weights** in neural networks
* Represent **datasets**
* Perform **linear transformations**
* Used in **matrix multiplication** to process input layers

### AI Example

A grayscale image (28×28 pixels) = 28×28 matrix of intensity values.
A neural network weight layer = matrix mapping inputs to outputs.

## Summary

* A **matrix** is a grid of numbers with rows and columns.
* Matrices are used to store and transform data.
* Essential in AI for representing data, weights, and computations.
* A matrix is a step beyond vectors—working in two dimensions!
