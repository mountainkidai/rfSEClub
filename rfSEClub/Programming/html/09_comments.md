# HTML Comments

Comments in HTML are notes you add in the code. They are not shown on the web page and are only visible in the source code.

## Why Use Comments?

* To explain what your code does
* To leave reminders
* To hide code temporarily while testing

## 1. Syntax for Comments

Use `<!--` to start a comment and `-->` to end it.

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
```

## 2. Example in Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Comments Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- This is the main heading -->
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>

  <!-- This paragraph talks about the site -->
  <p>This site shares tips and tutorials for beginners.</p>

  <!-- <p>This paragraph is hidden and wonâ€™t show up on the page.</p> -->
</body>
</html>
```

## 3. Output

The output of the above code will be:

```txt
Welcome to My Website
This site shares tips and tutorials for beginners.
```

> The hidden paragraph inside the comment will not appear on the webpage.
