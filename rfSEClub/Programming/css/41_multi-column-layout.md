# Multi-Column Layout in CSS

Multi-column layout allows you to display content in multiple columns, similar to how newspapers or magazines layout text. Itâ€™s useful for creating visually balanced blocks of content, especially for longer paragraphs.

## column-count

This property defines how many columns the content should be split into.

```css
.article {
  column-count: 3;
}
```

This means the content inside `.article` will flow into 3 columns.

* **Note:** The browser will automatically balance the height of the columns so they line up evenly, unless restricted by other styles.

---

## column-gap

Defines the space between each column.

```css
.article {
  column-count: 3;
  column-gap: 30px;
}
```

This adds 30px of space between each column, making the layout easier to read.

---

## column-rule

This adds a visual line between the columns (like a border between them).

```css
.article {
  column-count: 3;
  column-gap: 30px;
  column-rule: 1px solid #ccc;
}
```

* `1px` is the thickness of the rule.
* `solid` is the style of the line.
* `#ccc` is the color of the line.

This helps clearly separate the columns visually.

## Example: Complete Multi-Column Style

```css
.article {
  column-count: 2;
  column-gap: 20px;
  column-rule: 1px dashed gray;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

This would:

* Split the content into 2 columns.
* Add 20px space between them.
* Add a dashed gray line as a divider.

## Responsive Tip

You can combine multi-column layout with media queries:

```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .article {
    column-count: 1;
  }
}
```

This makes the layout stack into a single column on small screens.

---

## Summary

* `column-count`: Number of columns to divide content into.
* `column-gap`: Spacing between those columns.
* `column-rule`: Divider between columns.

This layout method is great for text-heavy sections to improve readability and visual balance.
