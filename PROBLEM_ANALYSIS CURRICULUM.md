# Problem Analysis Curriculum for rfSE Club | HP Initiative(First-Principles Approach)

## Overview

Problem analysis, rooted in first-principles thinking, teaches students to break down complex problems into fundamental components, question assumptions, and build solutions from scratch. This curriculum, designed by Aariv, emphasizes on why problems exist, what the core issues are, and how to solve them innovatively. Tailored for Himachal Pradesh’s challenges, it includes case studies on landslides, tourism issues, and traffic management.

### Curriculum Structure

#### 1. Introduction to First-Principles Thinking

- **What is First-Principles Thinking?**: Break problems into fundamental truths, question assumptions, and rebuild solutions (e.g., Elon’s approach to SpaceX: rockets are expensive → why? → materials, labor → can we reduce costs?).
- **Steps**:
  - Identify the problem.
  - Break it down to its core components.
  - Question every assumption.
  - Build a solution from first principles.
- **Example**: Why are textbooks expensive? → Paper, printing, distribution → Can we use digital platforms instead?

#### 2. Problem Analysis Framework

- **Define the Problem**: Clearly state the issue (e.g., landslides in Himachal).
- **Gather Data**: Collect facts (e.g., rainfall patterns, soil types, deforestation rates).
- **Identify Core Components**: What are the fundamental causes? (e.g., heavy rain, loose soil, lack of vegetation).
- **Question Assumptions**: Are current solutions (e.g., retaining walls) effective? Why not?
- **Propose Solutions**: Build from scratch (e.g., reforestation, early warning systems).

#### 3. Case Studies and Practice Questions

- **Case Study 1: Landslides in Himachal Pradesh**

  - **Problem**: Frequent landslides disrupt lives and infrastructure (e.g., Shimla-Kullu highway).
  - **Data**: Annual rainfall 1,500 mm, 30% deforestation in 10 years, loose soil in hilly areas.
  - **Core Components**: Heavy rain, deforestation, soil instability.
  - **Assumption to Question**: Are concrete walls the only solution? (Costly, often fail).
  - **Solution**: Reforestation to stabilize soil, AI-based early warning system using rainfall data.
  - **Practice Question**: Design a low-cost early warning system for landslides using local weather data and sensors. What are the first principles involved?

- **Case Study 2: Tourism Issues in Himachal Pradesh**

  - **Problem**: Unsustainable tourism damages the environment (e.g., littering in Rohtang Pass).
  - **Data**: 1.5 million tourists annually, 500 tons of waste generated, lack of regulation.
  - **Core Components**: High tourist influx, lack of waste management, unregulated activities.
  - **Assumption to Question**: Do we need to ban tourism? (Hurts local economy).
  - **Solution**: Blockchain-based tourist tracking (public price ledger, as in Phunsuk), mandatory eco-fees, AI waste monitoring.
  - **Practice Question**: How can we use technology to enforce sustainable tourism in Himachal? Break down the problem into first principles.

- **Case Study 3: Traffic Management in Shimla**
  - **Problem**: Traffic congestion in Shimla during tourist season (e.g., Mall Road).
  - **Data**: 10,000 vehicles daily in peak season, narrow roads, limited parking.
  - **Core Components**: High vehicle volume, limited road capacity, poor parking management.
  - **Assumption to Question**: Do we need wider roads? (Not feasible in hilly terrain).
  - **Solution**: AI-based traffic prediction, smart parking apps, incentivize public transport.
  - **Practice Question**: Design a traffic management system for Shimla using first-principles thinking. What are the core factors causing congestion?

#### 4. Practice Exercises

- **Exercise 1**: A village in Himachal faces water scarcity. Break down the problem: Why is there a shortage? (Rainfall, storage, distribution). Propose a solution using first principles.
- **Exercise 2**: Overcrowding at Jakhu Temple during festivals. Identify core issues (visitor volume, space, timing) and propose a solution (e.g., timed entry slots, virtual darshan).
- **Exercise 3**: Deforestation in Kullu due to tourism infrastructure. Question assumptions (e.g., do we need more hotels?) and propose a sustainable alternative.

#### 5. Expected Outcomes

- Students will master first-principles thinking, applying it to real-world problems.
- Develop innovative solutions for Himachal’s challenges, fostering a problem-solving mindset.
- Prepare for case studies in tech and engineering, aligning with MountainKid’s mission to build future engineers.
