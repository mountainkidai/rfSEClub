# rfSE Internet Explained: Chronological Questions for Top 1% Mastery

## Problem

Slow apps lose users, waste resources.  
Root: Inefficient code ignoring internet basics.  
Cost: Lost revenue, poor UX.  
Solution: Break to first principles. Understand data flow to optimize code.

## Key Vocab: Undeniable Truths

- **Packet**: Small data chunk (e.g., 1KB) with header (source/dest address, sequence). Truth: Data too big for single send; break/reassemble avoids full retransmit.
- **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Routes packets independently across networks. No guarantees—packets may lose, duplicate, reorder. Truth: Decentralized paths for resilience.
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Layers on IP for reliability—sequences packets, ACKs receipt, retransmits lost, controls flow/congestion. Truth: Fixes IP chaos for ordered, complete delivery.
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: Request-response for web (e.g., GET page). Plain text—vulnerable to intercept. Truth: Simple comms, but insecure.
- **HTTPS**: HTTP + encryption (TLS). Truth: Scrambles data in transit, prevents eavesdrop.
- **Bandwidth**: Max data rate (e.g., 100Mbps). Truth: Pipe width limits volume.
- **Latency**: Delay from send to receive (e.g., 50ms). Truth: Distance + hops slow response; critical for real-time.
- **Throughput**: Actual data volume/time (e.g., 80Mbps). Truth: Bandwidth minus losses/congestion; high means efficient flow.
- **Frontend**: User-facing (UI, browser code). Truth: Handles input/output.
- **Backend**: Server logic, databases. Truth: Processes data, stores persistently.
- **Decentralization**: No single failure point. Truth: Reroutes around issues for uptime.
- **Low Latency High Throughput**: Min delay + max volume. Truth: Edge compute near users, cache repeats, scale services independently.
